# bbTweaked Sweep Compact

A custom version of the [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep).

This verison has a tightenend up edge cut and removed the ferris silkscreen silkscreen.

## Notes:

+ This version is based on the sweep compact. As such, the two micro-controllers must be installed one facing up, the other facing down.
